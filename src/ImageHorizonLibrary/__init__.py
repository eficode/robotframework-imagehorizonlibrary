                          _OperatingSystem,

    '''A cross-platform Robot Framework library for GUI automation.

    ImageHorizonLibrary provides keyboard and mouse actions as well as
    facilities to recognize images on screen. It can also take screenshots in
    case of failure or otherwise.


    This library is built on top of
    [https://pyautogui.readthedocs.org|pyautogui].

    == Confidence Level ==
    By default, image recognition searches images with pixel-perfect matching.
    This is in many scenarios too precise, as changing desktop background,
    transpareny in the reference images, slightly changing resolutions, and
    myriad of factors might throw the algorithm off. In these cases, it is
    advised to adjust the precision manually.

    This ability to adjust can be enabled by installing
    [https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python|opencv-python] Python package
    separately:

    | $ pip install opencv-python

    After installation, the library will use OpenCV, which enables setting the
    precision during `library importing` and during the test case  with keyword
    `Set Confidence`.


    = Reference image names =
    ``reference_image`` parameter can be either a single file, or a folder.
    If ``reference_image`` is a folder, image recognition is tried separately
    for each image in that folder, in alphabetical order until a match is found.

    For ease of use, reference image names are automatically normalized
    according to the following rules:

    - The name is lower cased: ``MYPICTURE`` and ``mYPiCtUrE`` become
      ``mypicture``

    - All spaces are converted to underscore ``_``: ``my picture`` becomes
      ``my_picture``

    - If the image name does not end in ``.png``, it will be added:
      ``mypicture`` becomes ``mypicture.png``

    - Path to _reference folder_ is prepended. This option must be given when
      `importing` the library.

    Using good names for reference images is evident from easy-to-read test
    data:

    | `Import Library` | ImageHorizonLibrary                   | reference_folder=images |                                                            |
    | `Click Image`    | popup Window title                    |                         | # Path is images/popup_window_title.png                    |
    | `Click Image`    | button Login Without User Credentials |                         | # Path is images/button_login_without_user_credentials.png |

    = Performance =

    Locating images on screen, especially if screen resolution is large and
    reference image is also large, might take considerable time. It is
    therefore advisable to save the returned coordinates if you are
    manipulating the same context many times in the row:

    | `Wait For`                   | label Name |     |
    | `Click To The Left Of Image` | label Name | 200 |

    In the above example, same image is located twice. Below is an example how
    we can leverage the returned location:

    | ${location}=           | `Wait For`  | label Name |
    | `Click To The Left Of` | ${location} | 200        |

        ``reference_folder`` is path to the folder where all reference images
        are stored. It must be a _valid absolute path_. As the library
        is suite-specific (ie. new instance is created for every suite),
        different suites can have different folders for it's reference images.

        ``screenshot_folder`` is path to the folder where screenshots are
        saved. If not given, screenshots are saved to the current working
        directory.

        ``keyword_on_failure`` is the keyword to be run, when location-related
        keywords fail. If you wish to not take screenshots, use for example
        `BuiltIn.No Operation`. Keyword must however be a valid keyword.

        ``confidence`` provides a tolerance for the ``reference_image``.
                       It can be used if python-opencv is installed and
                       is given as number between 0 and 1. Not used
