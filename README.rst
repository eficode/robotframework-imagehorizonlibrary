image recognition similar to Sikuli. This library wraps pyautogui_ to achieve
this.

Prerequisites
-------------

- `Python 2.7+`_ (unfortunately not 3.x)
- pip_ for easy installation
- pyautogui_ and `it's prerequisites`_
- `Robot Framework`_

On OS X, Retina display might `double all coordinates`_ from what they are
suppose to be. Unfortunately you need to work around this problem yourself.

On Ubuntu, you need to take `special measures`_ to make the screenshot
functionality to work correctly. The keyboard functions might not work on
Ubuntu when run in VirtualBox on Windows.

Installation
------------

If you have pip_, installation is straightforward, although you need to
explicitly install pillow first:

::

    $ pip install pillow==2.9.0
    $ pip install robotframework-imagehorizonlibrary

This will automatically install dependencies as well as their dependencies.


Windows
'''''''

ImageHorizonLibrary should work on Windows "out-of-the-box". Just run the
commands above to install it.

OSX
'''

You additionally need to install these for pyautogui_:

::

    $ pip install pyobjc-core pyobjc


For these, you need to install XCode_

Linux
'''''

You additionally need to install these for pyautogui_:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-xlib
    $ sudo pip install pillow


You might also need, depending on your Python distribution, to install:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-tk

If you are using virtualenv, you must install python-xlib_ manually to the
virtual environment for pyautogui_:

- `Fetch the source distribution`_
- Install with:

  ::

        $ pip install python-xlib-<latest version>.tar.gz

Running tests
-------------

::

    $ python tests/utest/run_tests.py [verbosity=2]

and

::

    $ python tests/atest/run_tests.py
